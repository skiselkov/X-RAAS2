# This is a sample X-RAAS configuration file.
#
#	!!! READ THIS CAREFULLY !!!
#
# Everything on a line following a hash sign (#) is a comment and is
# ignored by X-RAAS. You can uncomment the following below to override
# how X-RAAS interacts with your simulator. To uncomment a line, simply
# remove the leading hash sign '#'. The parameters are simply pairs of:
#
#   <name> = <value>
#
# Uncommenting a parameter activates that change in X-RAAS. Otherwise
# the parameter will remain at its default value. After changing a
# parameter in the configuration file, reset X-RAAS via the Plugins
# menu, or reload the airplane for the change to take effect.
#
# This sample configuration file is included in the X-RAAS package in
# the `sample-config' folder. This folder is not read by X-RAAS. To use
# the config file, you must first move it to one of two places which
# X-RAAS does read:
#
#	*) <X-PLANE>/Output/preferences/X-RAAS.cfg
#	*) <X-PLANE>/Aircraft/<CURRENT AIRCRAFT'S FOLDER>/X-RAAS.cfg
#
# X-RAAS loads the files in this order, so any changes you make in an
# aircraft's X-RAAS.cfg overrides what is in the global X-RAAS.cfg in
# your preferences directory, which in turn overrides X-RAAS's hard-
# coded defaults. This way you can have personalized settings in the
# global X-RAAS.cfg file and just tailor them to a particular aircraft
# in the aircraft's X-RAAS.cfg.
#
# The X-RAAS configuration parameters are listed below with explanations
# on what they do.



#	Uncommenting the the parameter below disables X-RAAS. It is a
#	master knob and takes effect prior to any other initialization
#	steps. You can use this in an X-RAAS.cfg for only one aircraft
#	to either selectively disable or enable X-RAAS for it (e.g.
#	globally enabling X-RAAS, but disabling it on some aircraft).
#	Default value: true
#
# enabled = false



#	By default X-RAAS calls out runway lengths in feet. By setting
#	the parameter below to false, X-RAAS will read out runway
#	lengths in meters.
#	Default value: true
#
# use_imperial = false



#	In the United States, runways are allowed to have single-digit
#	identifiers, so runway '01' is simply referred to as runway '1'.
#	By default, X-RAAS uses the ICAO standard and always pronounces
#	runway numbers as two digits, prepending a '0' if necessary. If
#	you only fly within the US, you can set this parameter to true
#	to make X-RAAS pronounce runway identifiers in the US style.
#
# us_runway_numbers = true



#	Uncomment to make X-RAAS grow a pair.
#	Default value: true
#
# voice_female = false



#	By default, when X-RAAS annunciates a runway distance remaining
#	or available, it will append the units used for distance
#	measurement during the initial annunciation (e.g. "FIVE THOUSAND
#	FEET REMAINING" on landing). For brevity, subsequent
#	annunciations will only annunciate the number (e.g. "FOUR
#	THOUSAND REMAINING"). By setting the parameter below to false,
#	X-RAAS will never annunciate the units and instead always only
#	annunciate the numeric value of the distance.
#	Default value: true
#
# speak_units = false



#	If a late touchdown on landing is detected, this setting
#	controls what nomenclature is used to annunciate this fact:
#		true: annunciate late touchdown as 'DEEP LANDING'.
#		false: annunciate late touchdown as 'LONG LANDING'.
#	This setting does not control whether the long landing monitor
#	is enabled.
#	Default value: false
#
# say_deep_landing = true



#	The parameter below controls whether X-RAAS will auto-inhibit if
#	it detects the currently loaded aircraft is a helicopter.
#	Setting this to true will permit X-RAAS to start up regardless
#	of the aircraft type loaded. Please note that the parameters
#	min_engines and min_mtow must also be satisfied (see below).
#	Default value: false
#
# allow_helos = true



#	At startup, X-RAAS displays a short message at the bottom of the
#	screen to indicate to users that it is installed and working
#	correctly and what units it is configured with. Setting this
#	parameter to "false" disables that startup message on the screen.
#	Default value: true
#
# startup_notify = false



#	To help users quickly determine that X-RAAS is auto-disabled
#	due to parameter limitations (min_engines and min_mtow), X-RAAS
#	prints a short notice at the bottom of the screen for 25
#	seconds. You can disable this notification by setting this
#	parameter to false.
#	Default value: true

# auto_disable_notify = false



#	X-RAAS mutes annunciations when it detects that the current view
#	location is “external”, since these should only be audible when
#	inside the cockpit. Setting this to false will allow
#	annunciations to sound regardless if X-RAAS thinks your view is
#	inside the cockpit or not.
#	Default value: true
#
# disable_ext_view = false



#	Usually, when an aural advisory is generated, X-RAAS will issue
#	visual alerts on the aircraft's Navigation Display (ND) or the
#	fallback screen overlay display. Setting this parameter to false
#	disables all visual alerts. This setting does not affect aural
#	annunciations.
#	Default value: true
#
# nd_alerts_enabled = false



#	Provided nd_alerts_enabled is set to true, if the aircraft does
#	not provide proper visual alert integration, X-RAAS will attempt
#	to display visual alerts as an overlay near the top center of
#	the screen. Setting this parameter to false disables that
#	fallback mechanism. It does not disable display of visual alerts
#	on an aircraft's ND, provided the aircraft has been integrated
#	with X-RAAS's visual alert mechanism (refer to the manual,
#	section 8 for details on how to do this).
#	Default value: true
#
# nd_alert_overlay_enabled = false



#	Setting this parameter to true forces X-RAAS to display the ND
#	alert overlay even for aircraft it thinks don't have that
#	feature in the real world.
#	Default value: false
#
# nd_alert_overlay_force = true



#	Some aircraft models do not properly set the required datarefs
#	for X-RAAS to detect electrical power being applied to the
#	aircraft's avionics systems. If that's the case, you can set
#	this parameter to true to make X-RAAS always turn on, even if it
#	thinks electrical power isn't available.
#	Default value: false
#
# override_electrical = true



#	During replays, aircraft position can behave in strange and
#	non-predictable ways, which can cause X-RAAS to give spurious
#	annunciations. Therefore, if X-RAAS detects that the simulator
#	is in replay mode, it will auto-inhibit for the duration of the
#	replay. By setting this parameter to true, you can re-enable
#	X-RAAS during replays.
#	Default value: false
#
# override_replay = true



#	In case you encounter compatibility issues with audio playback
#	from X-RAAS and any other remedy is unavailable, you can force
#	X-RAAS to play aural annunciations using the host operating
#	system's text-to-speech function. The annunciations will be of
#	a lower quality, so use this option only as a fallback.
#	NOTE: this feature is not available on Linux.
#	Default value: false
#
# use_tts = true



#	When generating audio, X-RAAS can either use a dedicated OpenAL
#	audio context, or a context shared with the rest of X-Plane.
#	Certain audio drivers on Windows are known not to properly
#	support multiple OpenAL contexts. If you encounter audio
#	playback issues in that case, try to switch X-RAAS to use a
#	shared audio context.
#		true: X-RAAS should use an OpenAL audio driver context
#			shared with the rest of X-Plane.
#		false: X-RAAS should use its own dedicated OpenAL audio
#			driver context.
#	NOTE: operating using a shared context can result in compat-
#	ibility issues with certain 3rd party plugins and aircraft.
#	Default value: false
#
# openal_shared = true

#	true: the late rotation on takeoff monitor is enabled.
#	false: the late rotation on takeoff monitor is disabled.
#	Default value: true
#

#	Default value: 1.0
#
# voice_volume = 0.7



#	RAAS is primarily designed for airliners and is a poor fit for
#	light general aviation aircraft or special performance aircraft
#	such aerobatic aircraft. Provided the master "enabled" parameter
#	is set to "true" and the currently loaded aircraft isn't a
#	helicopter (see allow_helos above), X-RAAS also checks the
#	aircraft's number of engines and Maximum Take Off Weight (MTOW)
#	to see if the aircraft fulfills certain minimum criteria to be
#	considered an 'airliner'. To enable X-RAAS on all aircraft, set
#	both of these values to 0.
#	Default values:
#		Minimum number of engines: 2
#		Minimum MTOW: 5,700 kg
#
# min_engines = 2
# min_mtow = 5700



#	This is the minimum runway length remaining (in meters) that
#	X-RAAS will consider to be safe for conduting a takeoff. If an
#	aircraft lines up on a runway with less than this distance
#	remaining, X-RAAS will append a "XXXX REMAINING" message to the
#	"ON RUNWAY" annunciation to notify the pilot of potentially
#	insufficient runway length remaining for the takeoff roll and
#	will also generate a "SHORT RUNWAY! SHORT RUNWAY!" annunciation
#	if the takeoff roll (acceleration past 40 knots ground speed) is
#	initiated on such a runway.
#	Default value: 1000
#
# min_takeoff_dist = 1000



#	This is the minimum runway length remaining (in meters) that
#	X-RAAS will consider to be safe for conduting a landing. If an
#	aircraft lines up for landing on such a runway and passes below
#	470 ft AFE, X-RAAS will append a "CAUTION! SHORT RUNWAY! SHORT
#	RUNWAY!" to the "APPROACHING XXX" annunciation to notify the
#	pilot of potentially insufficient runway length remaining for
#	rollout.
#	Default value: 800
#
# min_landing_dist = 800



#	These are the minimum runway length remaining (in meters) and pitch
#	angle (in degrees) relative to the runway slope where X-RAAS will
#	start to issue runway length remaining annunciations on takeoff to
#	warn of the runway end approaching rapidly and the need to initiate
#	rotation immediately.
#	Default values:
#		Distance: 400 meters
#		Angle: 4 degrees
#
# min_rotation_dist = 400
# min_rotation_angle = 4



#	During landing, as long as the aircraft remains above 40 knots
#	ground speed, X-RAAS monitors the rate of deceleration to verify
#	that braking is sufficient to bring the aircraft to a complete
#	stop prior to reaching the end of the runway. If braking is
#	insufficient, X-RAAS commences runway length remaining
#	annunciations. To avoid nuisance annunciations during the initial
#	phase of landing rollout, this monitor is suppressed as long as
#	the amount of runway length remaining for stopping is greater
#	than a cutoff value. This cutoff value is defined as the greater
#	of 1/2 of the total runway length and the value below (in meters).
#	Default value: 1600
#
# stop_dist_cutoff = 1600



#	Aircraft are not normally meant to sit on runways for extended
#	periods of time. If an aircraft has been stationary (less than 3 KT
#	ground speed) on a runway for an extended period of time, X-RAAS
#	generates 'reminder' "ON RUNWAY" annunciations. It generates the
#	first such annunciation after on_rwy_warn_initial number of
#	seconds (by default 60). Then it generates further "ON RUNWAY"
#	annunciations every on_rwy_warn_repeat seconds (by default 120).
#	To prevent excessive annoyance to crews having to hold on the runway
#	for extended periods of time, it will stop after having made a total
#	of on_rwy_warn_max_n annunciations (by default 3). If the aircraft
#	moves on the runway (accelerates past 3 KT ground speed), this timer
#	and message counter is reset. This does not disable the 'on runway'
#	annunciation when initially lining up.
#	Default values: 60 (initial), 120 (repeat), 3 (max_n)
#
# on_rwy_warn_initial = 60
# on_rwy_warn_repeat = 120
# on_rwy_warn_max_n = 3



#	These control the glidepath angle limit calculation for "TOO HIGH"
#	annunciations. The multiplier value is applied to the optimum
#	glidepath angle for the runway from the navigation database, so if
#	for example a runway is defined as having an optimum glidepath of
#	3 degrees and the multiplier is 1.5, then the limiting glidepath
#	angle that X-RAAS will permit is 4.5 degrees.
#	The maximum value limits the computation to an absolute upper bound.
#	Even if the multiplied glidepath angle were greater, X-RAAS will
#	treat gpa_limit_max as the hard upper limit.
#
# gpa_limit_mult = 1.5
# gpa_limit_max = 3



#	These values determine the fraction of the runway length from
#	the approach end of the runway where a landing should be performed,
#	before a long landing annunciation is made (refer to section 4.14).
#	The parameter long_land_lim_abs defines the absolute longest
#	length (in meters) from the approach runway end. The
#	long_land_lim_fract parameter defines the runway length as a
#	fraction of the runway length. The lesser of these two values is
#	considered the “normal” landing range.
#	The minimum and maximum values for long_land_lim_fract are 0.0 and
#	1.0 respectively.
#	Default values:
#		long_land_lim_abs: 610
#		long_land_lim_fract: 0.25
#
# long_land_lim_abs = 610
# long_land_lim_fract = 0.25



#	X-RAAS monitors the selection of landing flaps on approach to
#	landing. This parameter is defined as the minimum "flaprqst"
#	dataref value (relative flap handle position from 0.0 for flaps
#	up to 1.0 for full flaps down) that is considered valid landing
#	flaps. If the aircraft is lined up with the runway and flaps are
#	set to less than this value and the aircraft descends thru 950 ft
#	AFE, X-RAAS generates a "FLAPS! FLAPS!" annunciation. If flaps
#	remain above this limit past 600 feet AFE, X-RAAS generates a
#	second "FLAPS! FLAPS!" annunciation. Finally, descending thru
#	470 ft AFE without flaps in the landing configuration, X-RAAS
#	generates a "UNSTABLE! UNSTABLE!" annunciation.
#	To disable this annunciation, set min_landing_flap = 0
#	Default value: 0.5
#
# min_landing_flap = 0.5



#	Same as min_landing_flap, but takeoff. If the aircraft lines up
#	on a runway and flaps are set to less than this value, X-RAAS
#	appends a "FLAPS! FLAPS!" message to the "ON RUNWAY" annunciation.
#	It won't generate any further annunciations after takeoff is
#	initiated, as most airliners contain a takeoff configuration horn,
#	which will notify you plenty of your mistake. This RAAS
#	annunciation is simply to prevent the takeoff configuration horn
#	warning, as that necessitates aborting the takeoff. To completely
#	disable this annunciation, set min_takeoff_flap = 0
#	Default value: 0.1
#
# min_takeoff_flap = 0.1



#	Same as min_takeoff_flap, but is an upper bound on the valid flap
#	setting for takeoff. To completely disable this annunciation, set
#	max_takeoff_flap = 1
#	Default value: 0.75
#
# max_takeoff_flap = 0.75



#	Defines how long (in seconds) visual advisories remain on the
#	navigation display.
#	Default value: 7
#
# nd_alert_timeout = 7



#	Sets up a filter for which visual annunciations will be displayed
#	on the navigation display or overlay. Valid values are:
#		0: display all annunciations
#		1: display only non-routine and caution annunciations
#		2: display only caution annunciations
#	Default value: 0
#
# nd_alert_filter = 0



#	Specifies the font file (TTF) to use for the fallback screen
#	overlay. To use a custom font, place the font file into the
#	X-RAAS plugin folder under "data/fonts" and specify its
#	filename here.
#	Default value: <undefined>	(uses the default font)
#
# nd_alert_overlay_font = folder/file.ttf



#	The pixel size of the font to use for the ND alert overlay.
#	Default value: 28
#
# nd_alert_overlay_font_size = 32
