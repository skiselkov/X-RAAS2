-- This is the X-RAAS configuration file.
--
--	!!! READ THIS CAREFULLY !!!
--
-- Everything on a line following a double dash (--) is a comment and is
-- ignored by X-RAAS. You can uncomment the following clauses below to
-- override how X-RAAS interacts with your simulator. To uncomment a line,
-- simply remove the leading double dashes '--'. The parameters are simply
-- pairs of:
--
--   <name> = <value>
--
-- Uncommenting a parameter activates that change in X-RAAS. Otherwise the
-- parameter will remain at its default value. After changing a parameter
-- in the configuration file, reload the FlyWithLua scripts or reload the
-- airplane for the change to take effect.
--
-- X-RAAS reads configuration files from two places:
--
--	*) <X-PLANE 10>/Resources/plugins/X-RAAS/X-RAAS.cfg
--	*) <X-PLANE 10>/Aircraft/<CURRENT AIRCRAFT'S FOLDER>/X-RAAS.cfg
--
-- X-RAAS loads the files in this order, so any changes you make in an
-- aircraft's X-RAAS.cfg overrides what is in the global X-RAAS.cfg in
-- your Lua Scripts directory, which in turn overrides X-RAAS's hard-coded
-- defaults. This way you can have personalized settings in the global
-- X-RAAS.cfg file and just tailor them to a particular aircraft in the
-- aircraft's X-RAAS.cfg.
--
-- The X-RAAS configuration parameters are listed below with explanations
-- on what they do.



--	Uncommenting the following line disables X-RAAS. It is a master knob
--	and takes effect prior to any other initialization steps.
--	You can use this in an X-RAAS.cfg for only one aircraft to either
--	selectively disable or enable X-RAAS for it (e.g. globally enabling
--	X-RAAS, but disabling it on fighters).
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_enabled = false



--	The parameter below controls whether X-RAAS will auto-inhibit if it
--	detects the currently loaded aircraft is a helicopter. Setting this
--	to true will permit X-RAAS to start up regardless of the aircraft
--	type loaded. Please note that the parameters RAAS_min_engines and
--	RAAS_min_MTOW must also be satisfied (see below).
--	Default value: false

-- RAAS_allow_helos = true



--	RAAS is primarily designed for airliners and is a poor fit for
--	light general aviation aircraft or special performance aircraft
--	such aerobatic aircraft. Provided the master "RAAS_enabled" parameter
--	is set to "true" and the currently loaded aircraft isn't a helicopter
--	(see RAAS_allow_helos above), X-RAAS also checks the aircraft's
--	number of engines and Maximum Take Off Weight (MTOW) to see if the
--	aircraft fulfills certain minimum criteria to be considered an
--	'airliner'. To enable X-RAAS on all aircraft, set both of these
--	values to 0.
--	Default values:
--		Minimum number of engines: 2
--		Minimum MTOW: 5,700 kg

-- RAAS_min_engines = 2
-- RAAS_min_MTOW = 5700



--	To help users quickly determine that X-RAAS is auto-disabled due
--	to parameter limitations (see above), X-RAAS prints a short notice
--	at the bottom of the screen for 25 seconds. You can disable this
--	notification by setting this parameter to false.
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_auto_disable_notify = false



--	At startup, X-RAAS displays a short message at the bottom of the
--	screen to indicate to users that it is installed and working
--	correctly and what units it is configured with. Setting this
--	parameter to "false" disables that startup message on the screen.
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_startup_notify = false



--	By default X-RAAS reads out runway length remaining in thousands
--	of feet. By uncommenting the line below, X-RAAS will read out
--	runway length remaining in increments of 300 meters.
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_use_imperial = false



--	Uncomment to make X-RAAS grow a pair.
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_voice_female = false



--	Sets the relative volume of the RAAS announcements from 0.0
--	(silence) to 1.0 (full volume).
--	Default value: 1.0

-- RAAS_voice_volume = 0.7



--	Due to known compatibility issues with certain 3rd party add-ons,
--	on some installations, X-RAAS may not be able to play aural
--	annunciations. If that is the case and you don't want to disable
--	the incompatible 3rd party add-on, setting the parameter below to
--	`true' will make X-RAAS use X-Plane's built-in text-to-speech
--	engine to generate annunciations. The annunciations will be of
--	a lower quality, so use this option only as a fallback.
--	Default value: false

-- RAAS_use_TTS = true



--	In the United States, runways are allowed to have single-digit
--	numbers, so runway “01” is simply referred to as runway “1”. By
--	default, X-RAAS uses the ICAO standard and always pronounces
--	runway numbers as two digits, prepending a “0” if necessary. If
--	you only fly within the US, you can set this parameter to true
--	to make X-RAAS pronounce single-digit runways without prepending
--	a “0”.

-- RAAS_US_runway_numbers = true



--	This is the minimum runway length remaining (in meters) that
--	X-RAAS will consider to be safe for conduting a takeoff. If an
--	aircraft lines up on a runway with less than this distance
--	remaining, X-RAAS will append a "XXXX REMAINING" message to the
--	"ON RUNWAY" annunciation to notify the pilot of potentially
--	insufficient runway length remaining for the takeoff roll and
--	will also generate a "SHORT RUNWAY! SHORT RUNWAY!" annunciation
--	if the takeoff roll (acceleration past 40 knots ground speed) is
--	initiated on such a runway.
--	Default value: 1000

-- RAAS_min_takeoff_dist = 1000



--	This is the minimum runway length remaining (in meters) that
--	X-RAAS will consider to be safe for conduting a landing. If an
--	aircraft lines up for landing on such a runway and passes below
--	470 ft AFE, X-RAAS will append a "CAUTION! SHORT RUNWAY! SHORT
--	RUNWAY!" to the "APPROACHING XXX" annunciation to notify the
--	pilot of potentially insufficient runway length remaining for
--	rollout.
--	Default value: 800

-- RAAS_min_landing_dist = 800



--	These are the minimum runway length remaining (in meters) and pitch
--	angle (in degrees) relative to the runway slope where X-RAAS will
--	start to issue runway length remaining annunciations on takeoff to
--	warn of the runway end approaching rapidly and the need to initiate
--	rotation immediately.
--	Default values:
--		Distance: 400 meters
--		Angle: 4 degrees

-- RAAS_min_rotation_dist = 400
-- RAAS_min_rotation_angle = 4



--	X-RAAS monitors the selection of landing flaps on approach to
--	landing. This parameter is defined as the minimum "flaprqst"
--	dataref value (relative flap handle position from 0.0 for flaps
--	up to 1.0 for full flaps down) that is considered valid landing
--	flaps. If the aircraft is lined up with the runway and flaps are
--	set to less than this value and the aircraft descends thru 950 ft
--	AFE, X-RAAS generates a "FLAPS! FLAPS!" annunciation. If flaps
--	remain above this limit past 600 feet AFE, X-RAAS generates a
--	second "FLAPS! FLAPS!" annunciation. Finally, descending thru
--	470 ft AFE without flaps in the landing configuration, X-RAAS
--	generates a "UNSTABLE! UNSTABLE!" annunciation.
--	To disable this annunciation, set RAAS_min_landing_flap = 0
--	Default value: 0.5

-- RAAS_min_landing_flap = 0.5



--	Same as RAAS_min_landing_flap, but takeoff. If the aircraft lines
--	up on a runway and flaps are set to less than this value, X-RAAS
--	appends a "FLAPS! FLAPS!" message to the "ON RUNWAY" annunciation.
--	It won't generate any further annunciations after takeoff is
--	initiated, as most airliners contain a takeoff configuration horn,
--	which will notify you plenty of your mistake. This RAAS
--	annunciation is simply to prevent the takeoff configuration horn
--	warning, as that necessitates aborting the takeoff. To completely
--	disable this annunciation, set RAAS_min_takeoff_flap = 0
--	Default value: 0.1

-- RAAS_min_takeoff_flap = 0.1



--	Same as RAAS_min_takeoff_flap, but is an upper bound on the valid
--	flap setting for takeoff. To completely disable this annunciation,
--	set RAAS_max_takeoff_flap = 1
--	Default value: 0.75

-- RAAS_max_takeoff_flap = 0.75



--	Aircraft are not normally meant to sit on runways for extended
--	periods of time. If an aircraft has been stationary (less than 3 KT
--	ground speed) on a runway for an extended period of time, X-RAAS
--	generates 'reminder' "ON RUNWAY" annunciations. It generates the
--	first such annunciation after RAAS_on_rwy_warn_initial number of
--	seconds (by default 60). Then it generates further "ON RUNWAY"
--	annunciations every RAAS_on_rwy_warn_repeat seconds (by default
--	120). To prevent excessive annoyance to crews having to hold on
--	the runway for extended periods of time, it will stop after
--	having made a total of RAAS_on_rwy_warn_max_n annunciations (by
--	default 3). If the aircraft moves on the runway (accelerates past
--	3 KT ground speed), this timer and message counter is reset. To
--	completely disable runway holding detection, set
--	RAAS_on_rwy_warn_max_n = 0. This does not disable the 'on runway'
--	annunciation when initially lining up.
--	Default values: 60 (initial), 120 (repeat), 3 (max_n)

-- RAAS_on_rwy_warn_initial = 60
-- RAAS_on_rwy_warn_repeat = 120
-- RAAS_on_rwy_warn_max_n = 3



--	When an aircraft is on approach to land and the database indicates
--	an optimum approach angle, X-RAAS monitors the approach angle and
--	if the angle is excessive, it will issue three warnings: 'TOO HIGH!
--	(pause) TOO HIGH!' descending through 950 to 600 feet AFE, a second
--	'TOO HIGH! TOO HIGH!' descending through 600 - 450 feet AFE, and
--	finally a 'UNSTABLE! UNSTABLE!' descending through 450 - 300 feet
--	AFE. Uncommenting the line below will disable these warnings. Refer
--	to section 4.12 of the user manual for a more complete description
--	of what contitutes an excessive approach angle.
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_too_high_enabled = false



--	On approach, if the aircraft supports setting a landing speed in
--	the FMC, X-RAAS will monitor aircraft airspeed and will issue the
--	following three warnings if the airspeed becomes excessive: 'TOO FAST!
--	(pause) TOO FAST!' descending through 950 to 600 feet AFE, a second
--	'TOO FAST! TOO FAST!' descending through 600 - 450 feet AFE, and
--	finally a 'UNSTABLE! UNSTABLE!' descending through 450 - 300 feet
--	AFE. Uncommenting the line below will disable these warnings. Refer
--	to section 4.13 of the user manual for a more complete description
--	of what contitutes an excessive approach speed and a list of
--	supported aircraft.
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_too_fast_enabled = false



--	These control the glidepath angle limit calculation for "TOO HIGH"
--	annunciations. The multiplier value is applied to the optimum
--	glidepath angle for the runway from the navigation database, so if
--	for example a runway is defined as having an optimum glidepath of
--	3 degrees and the multiplier is 1.5, then the limiting glidepath
--	angle that X-RAAS will permit is 4.5 degrees.
--	The maximum value limits the computation to an absolute upper bound.
--	Even if the multiplied glidepath angle were greater, X-RAAS will
--	treat RAAS_gpa_limit_max as the hard upper limit.

-- RAAS_gpa_limit_mult = 1.5
-- RAAS_gpa_limit_max = 3



--	X-RAAS monitors your altimeter setting to prevent forgetting to
--	reset the barometric altimeter subscale to QNE above transition
--	altitude and back to QNH or QFE when below transition level.
--	Forgetting to set the appropriate altimeter setting can result in
--	incorrect flight level (increasing risk of traffic collisions) or
--	in a CFIT (Controlled Flight Into Terrain). The real world RAAS
--	interacts with the FMS of the aircraft to determine origin and
--	destination aerodromes and sets up its transition altitude and
--	transition level based on what's set in the FMS. X-RAAS obviously
--	can't interface with 3rd party FMS addons, so it instead attempts
--	to guess the transition altitude/level based on database entries
--	for the airports around the aircraft, as well as GPS elevation
--	and barometric indications. It doesn't always get this 100% right,
--	so if you don't want to deal with this indication, you can disable
--	all altimeter checks.
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_alt_setting_enabled = false



--	When altimeter checks are enabled, when descending through transition
--	level, these parameters determine what type of altimeter setting
--	checks are preformed by X-RAAS. When QNH setting is allowed, X-RAAS
--	checks to make sure that the barometric altimeter reading is within a
--	pre-computed margin from GPS-computed elevation above mean sea level.
--	When QFE setting is allowed, X-RAAS checks to make sure that the
--	altimeter reading is within a pre-computed margin from above field
--	elevation of the nearest airport. Setting both parameters to true
--	allows either altimeter setting, whereas setting both parameters to
--	false disables barometric altimeter checking on descent.
--	Default values:
--		QNH altimetry: true
--		QFE altimetry: false

-- RAAS_qnh_alt_enabled = true
-- RAAS_qfe_alt_enabled = false



--	X-RAAS mutes annunciations when it detects that the current view
--	location is “external”, since these should only be audible when inside
--	the cockpit. Setting this to false will allow annunciations to sound
--	regardless if X-RAAS thinks your view is inside the cockpit or not.
--	Default value: true

--- RAAS_disable_ext_view = false



--	Some aircraft models do not properly set the required datarefs for
--	X-RAAS to detect electrical power being applied to the aircraft's
--	avionics systems. If that's the case, you can set this parameter to
--	true to make X-RAAS always turn on, even if it thinks electrical
--	power isn't available.
--	Default value: false

-- RAAS_override_electrical = true



--	During replays, aircraft position can behave in strange and
--	non-predictable ways, which can cause X-RAAS to give spurious
--	annunciations. Therefore, if X-RAAS detects that the simulator
--	is in replay mode, it will auto-inhibit for the duration of the
--	replay. By setting this parameter to true, you can re-enable X-RAAS
--	during replays.
--	Default value: false

-- RAAS_override_replay = true



--	By default X-RAAS will annunciate the units used for distance
--	measurement during an initial distance remaining or available
--	annunciation (e.g. "5000 FEET REMAINING" on landing). For brevity,
--	subsequent annunciations will only annunciate the number (e.g.
--	"4000 REMAINING"). By setting the parameter below to false,
--	X-RAAS will never annunciate the units and instead always only
--	annunciate the numeric value of the distance.
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_speak_units = false



--	These values determine the fraction of the runway length from
--	the approach end of the runway where a landing should be performed,
--	before a long landing annunciation is made (refer to section 4.14).
--	The parameter RAAS_long_land_lim_abs defines the absolute longest
--	length (in meters) from the approach runway end. The
--	RAAS_long_land_lim_fract parameter defines the runway length as a
--	fraction of the runway length. The lesser of these two values is
--	considered the “normal” landing range.
--	The minimum and maximum values for RAAS_long_land_lim_fract are
--	0.0 and 1.0 respectively.
--	Default values:
--		RAAS_long_land_lim_abs: 610
--		RAAS_long_land_lim_fract: 0.25

-- RAAS_long_land_lim_abs = 610
-- RAAS_long_land_lim_fract = 0.25



--	During landing, as long as the aircraft remains above 40 knots
--	ground speed, X-RAAS monitors the rate of deceleration to verify
--	that braking is sufficient to bring the aircraft to a complete
--	stop prior to reaching the end of the runway. If braking is
--	insufficient, X-RAAS commences runway length remaining
--	annunciations. To avoid nuisance annunciations during the initial
--	phase of landing rollout, this monitor is suppressed as long as
--	the amount of runway length remaining for stopping is greater
--	than a cutoff value. This cutoff value is defined as the greater
--	of 1/2 of the total runway length and the value below (in meters).
--	Default value: 1600

-- RAAS_stop_dist_cutoff = 1600



--	Usually, when an aural advisory is generated, X-RAAS will issue
--	visual alerts on the aircraft's Navigation Display (ND) or the
--	fallback screen overlay display. Setting this parameter to false
--	disables all visual alerts. This setting does not affect aural
--	annunciations.
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_ND_alerts_enabled = false



--	Sets up a filter for which visual annunciations will be displayed
--	on the navigation display or overlay. Valid values are:
--		0: display all annunciations
--		1: display only non-routine and caution annunciations
--		2: display only caution annunciations
--	Default value: 0

-- RAAS_ND_alert_filter = 0




--	Provided RAAS_ND_alerts_enabled is set to true, if the aircraft
--	does not provide proper visual alert integration, X-RAAS will
--	attempt to display visual alerts as an overlay near the top center
--	of the screen. Setting this parameter to false disables that
--	fallback mechanism. It does not disable display of visual alerts
--	on an aircraft's ND, provided the aircraft has been integrated
--	with X-RAAS's visual alert mechanism (refer to the manual, section
--	8 for details on how to do this).
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_ND_alert_overlay_enabled = false



--	Setting this parameter to true forces X-RAAS to display the ND alert
--	overlay even for aircraft it thinks don't have that feature in the
--	real world.
--	Default value: false

-- RAAS_ND_alert_overlay_force = true



--	Defines how long (in seconds) visual advisories remain on the
--	navigation display.
--	Default value: 7

-- RAAS_ND_alert_timeout = 7
