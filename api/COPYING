The sample code under this directory is licensed under the MIT License.
This allows you to include it freely in your product without having to
release source code and places minimal restrictions on your use of
X-RAAS's ND decoder routines. This license does not cover the main
implementation of the X-RAAS plugin, which remains under the CDDL (which
is still a fairly permissive license, but for example does require that
you release changes to X-RAAS's code).
